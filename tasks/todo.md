## Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Auth Provider | Privy | Web3-native, supports email+wallet, good DX |
| Database | Railway Postgres | Same platform as hosting, simple billing |
| DB Client | @neondatabase/serverless | Works with any Postgres, serverless-friendly |
| Anonymous Mode | Yes | Lower friction, localStorage fallback |
| Data Sync | Debounced writes | Avoid excessive API calls |
